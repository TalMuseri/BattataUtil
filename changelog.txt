Changelog
------------------------------
0.1-alpha:
    * Added "/neat" command.
0.2-alpha:
    * Fixed the "/neat" command so it actually works now.
0.3-alpha:
    * When neat mode shuts down, it first enables sendCmdFeedback and then cmdBlockOutput so you won't get a chat msg informing you about
      sendCmdFeedback turning on.
    * The "/neat" command is now "/dev"
    * Added the new "/neat" command (AlwaysDay & NeverRain)
    * Added "/opgear" command.
    * Commands' description actually shows up in the help menu. (I miss-spelled the word description in plugin.yml)
